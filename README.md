Phishing Email Analysis Methodology and Procedure

This document outlines the systematic steps taken to execute the analysis of a simulated phishing attempt as part of the cybersecurity awareness project.

Step 1: Simulated Phishing Email Creation (The Sample)

The first step involved engineering a realistic, yet flawed, phishing email to serve as the subject for analysis.

Goal: To simulate an amateur attacker's email aimed at harvesting credentials.

Tactics Included: The email was drafted to contain multiple indicators of compromise (IoCs) and social engineering techniques, including:

Urgency and Threat: Using phrases like "Immediate Action Required" and threats of imminent account deletion (e.g., "deletted in 24 hours").

Amateur Errors: Purposefully inserting spelling mistakes (suspecious, lockked, fradulent) and grammatical errors to mimic poor attention to detail often found in mass-phishing campaigns.

Deceptive Linking: Employing a hyperlink that disguised a suspicious external domain (secure-logins.info) behind benign link text.

Generic Salutation: Using the non-personalized greeting "Dear Customer."

Step 2: Critical Analysis and Indicator Detection

The generated sample email was then subjected to a rigorous security analysis to detect and classify all phishing indicators.

Review Focus: The analysis focused on three key areas:

Source Verification: Checking the authenticity of the sender's actual domain (support@customer-service-portal.net) versus the display name ("Security Department").

Content Analysis: Identifying social engineering tactics (threats, urgency, emotional manipulation) and cataloging all spelling and grammatical inconsistencies.

Link Inspection: Hovering over the embedded link to reveal the final, suspicious destination URL which did not match the expected official domain.

Result: All findings were compiled to create a comprehensive list of red flags associated with the sample.

Step 3: Formal Documentation and Reporting

The final phase involved converting the raw findings into a structured, professional report and project summary.

Documentation: All indicators detected in Step 2 were formally organized into categories (e.g., Urgency/Threat, Source Anomaly, Quality Errors).

Report Generation: The final Phishing Email Indicators Analysis Report (Phishing_Email_Analysis_Report.md) was produced, featuring the sample email itself and the detailed breakdown of the detected vulnerabilities.

Project Summary: This methodology document was created to summarize the entire process flow for project documentation.
